# Question:

**Use a language model to write a program that does the following:**

1.Takes a text string as input

2.Outputs a message about the sentiment of the text string, whether it’s “Positive”, “Negative” or “Neutral”. See also [Sentiment Analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-concept-analysis-and-applications-6c94d6f58c17)

* Include tests showing all the sentiments and submit a word document with screenshots of the program operations and tests.  
* Use any programming language you prefer  
* Include the entire related LLM (ChatGPT) session history in your submission for this assignment, including all the prompts you used.  
* Try Testing it on a sentiment dataset, e.g., [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset)

        	First, use a simplistic prompt, and show the initial score from HackerRank

        	Second, use Prompt Engineering techniques to refine your answer, and show the HackerRank score for the improved answer
