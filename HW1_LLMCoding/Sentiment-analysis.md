> Using Python and any libraries as needed, write a program that takes a text string as input, process and transform the input text as needed, then run a sentiment analysis on the input, and finally return one of these three sentiments as the output: "neutral","positive","negative". Before actually writing the program, first show me the libraries that you would use and explain their purpose.

Here‚Äôs the stack I‚Äôd use and why:

- **re** (stdlib): fast, flexible text cleanup (strip URLs, emails, mentions, extra whitespace, etc.).
- **ftfy**: fixes mojibake/odd encodings so models see clean Unicode.
- **emoji**: converts üòä ‚Üí ‚Äú:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:‚Äù so sentiment models can pick up cues.
- **transformers**: provides a ready-to-use sentiment model and `pipeline` API.
- **torch**: backend needed by most Transformer models.

Below is a compact, production-ready script that:
1) normalizes/cleans the text,  
2) runs a 3-class sentiment model,  
3) returns exactly one of `"neutral" | "positive" | "negative"`.

```python
# sentiment_analyzer.py
import re
from typing import Literal

import ftfy
import emoji
from transformers import pipeline

Sentiment = Literal["neutral", "positive", "negative"]

# 1) Text normalization / cleanup
_URL_RE = re.compile(r"https?://\S+|www\.\S+", re.IGNORECASE)
_EMAIL_RE = re.compile(r"\b[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+\b")
_MENTION_RE = re.compile(r"(?<!\w)@[\w_]+")
_HASHTAG_RE = re.compile(r"(?<!\w)#[\w_]+")
_MULTI_WS_RE = re.compile(r"\s+")

def normalize(text: str) -> str:
    # Fix weird encodings and normalize whitespace
    text = ftfy.fix_text(text)
    # Demojize so models see explicit sentiment tokens
    text = emoji.demojize(text, language="en")
    # Lowercase (keeps model behavior consistent, optional)
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove or soften noisy tokens (URLs/emails/handles)
    text = _URL_RE.sub(" ", text)
    text = _EMAIL_RE.sub(" ", text)
    text = _MENTION_RE.sub(" ", text)
    # Keep hashtag words but drop the '#'
    text = _HASHTAG_RE.sub(lambda m: m.group(0).replace("#", ""), text)
    # Collapse whitespace
    text = _MULTI_WS_RE.sub(" ", text).strip()
    return text

# 2) Initialize a 3-class sentiment pipeline (neg/neu/pos)
#    Model labels: ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']
_sia = pipeline(
    "text-classification",
    model="cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest",
    top_k=None,  # get full distribution if you want to extend later
)

LABEL_MAP = {"NEGATIVE": "negative", "NEUTRAL": "neutral", "POSITIVE": "positive",
             "negative": "negative", "neutral": "neutral", "positive": "positive"}

def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> Sentiment:
    cleaned = normalize(text)
    if not cleaned:
        return "neutral"
    result = _sia(cleaned, truncation=True)[0]  # first/only item
    # result like: {'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82}
    label = LABEL_MAP.get(result["label"], "neutral")
    return label  # one of "negative"/"neutral"/"positive"

# 3) Tiny CLI
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if sys.stdin.isatty():
        # text passed as an argument: python sentiment_analyzer.py "I love this!"
        text = " ".join(sys.argv[1:]).strip()
    else:
        # or pipe: echo "I love this!" | python sentiment_analyzer.py
        text = sys.stdin.read().strip()
    if not text:
        print("neutral")
        sys.exit(0)
    print(analyze_sentiment(text))
```

**Install once:**
```bash
pip install ftfy emoji transformers torch --upgrade
```

**Run examples:**
```bash
python sentiment_analyzer.py "This is fine."
# -> neutral

python sentiment_analyzer.py "Absolutely loved it üòä"
# -> positive

echo "This was a terrible experience..." | python sentiment_analyzer.py
# -> negative
```

> Is it easier to produce this program if I use the Textblob library for sentiment analysis?

Yes ‚Äî using **TextBlob** makes the program *simpler* to write, but there are trade-offs.

### Why it‚Äôs easier with TextBlob
- **Single library**: TextBlob has sentiment analysis built in, no need to load large transformer models.
- **No deep learning setup**: You don‚Äôt need to install PyTorch/Transformers or download models.
- **Lightweight**: Faster startup and runs on CPU instantly.

### How it works
TextBlob uses a **rule-/lexicon-based** approach (pattern analyzer). It gives:
- **polarity**: a float in `[-1.0, 1.0]` (negative ‚Üí positive).
- **subjectivity**: how subjective vs. factual the text is.

You can map polarity into your required labels (`negative`, `neutral`, `positive`) with thresholds.

### Example implementation

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> str:
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    polarity = blob.sentiment.polarity
    
    # thresholds: you can adjust as needed
    if polarity > 0.1:
        return "positive"
    elif polarity < -0.1:
        return "negative"
    else:
        return "neutral"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_texts = [
        "I love this product!",
        "This is the worst experience ever.",
        "It works as expected."
    ]
    for t in sample_texts:
        print(f"{t} ‚Üí {analyze_sentiment(t)}")
```

### Pros and cons
- ‚úÖ **Easy & fast**: just `pip install textblob`, no GPU needed.  
- ‚úÖ **Good for simple projects or demos**.  
- ‚ùå **Lower accuracy** than modern transformer models, especially on nuanced text, slang, or emoji.  
- ‚ùå Not context-aware (just bag-of-words style).  

---

üëâ If your goal is **simplicity** and you‚Äôre okay with less accuracy, TextBlob is the easier choice.  
üëâ If you want **state-of-the-art performance**, stick with **Transformers**.  

Would you like me to show you a **side-by-side comparison script** that runs both TextBlob and a transformer model on the same input so you can see the differences?

> Now for testing, generate 15 different sentences in English that does not contain emoji with varied sentiments (neutral, negative, positive), then run a test on these sentences, using the 2 programs you generated above (one using transformer, the other using TextBlob). Show the test results.

Here are 15 test sentences (no emoji) and their labels from a quick **fallback** classifier I just ran locally (since this environment is offline and can‚Äôt download models or install TextBlob). You can scroll the table labeled **‚ÄúSentiment test set (fallback results shown here)‚Äù** above.

If you want to run the exact two programs we discussed (Transformer + TextBlob) on your machine, use this self-contained harness. It prints a side-by-side comparison and enforces the output to exactly one of `neutral | positive | negative`.

### What I did here (now) vs. what you‚Äôll see locally
- **Now (in this chat):** I showed results from a tiny, rule-based fallback so you can inspect the 15-sentence set immediately.
- **Locally (with internet):** Run `test_bench.py` to execute the two **actual** programs: the **Transformer** model and **TextBlob**, side by side, on the same 15 sentences. That will give you the real comparison you asked for.

> In the test set, there is no test input with the sentiment label as "neutral". Make a wholisic test set with 15 sentences, and 5 sentences for each sentiment.

Got it üëç ‚Äî thanks for catching that. Let‚Äôs design a **balanced test set** with exactly **5 neutral, 5 positive, and 5 negative** sentences.  

Here‚Äôs a holistic set of 15 sentences:

---

### **Neutral (5)**
1. The train is scheduled to arrive at 7:45 AM.  
2. The document consists of ten pages.  
3. The meeting was rescheduled to Thursday afternoon.  
4. The store is located across the street from the library.  
5. The temperature today is 20 degrees Celsius.  

---

### **Positive (5)**
6. The customer support team handled my issue quickly and professionally.  
7. I‚Äôm very pleased with the clarity and quality of this new monitor.  
8. The book was engaging and full of valuable insights.  
9. She delivered her presentation with confidence and precision.  
10. I had a wonderful time exploring the new art exhibit.  

---

### **Negative (5)**
11. The package arrived damaged and missing several items.  
12. The restaurant service was extremely slow and inattentive.  
13. This new software update caused more problems than it solved.  
14. The film‚Äôs plot was predictable and painfully boring.  
15. I felt disappointed after waiting hours only to be turned away.  

---

üëâ This set ensures **even distribution** across the three categories (`neutral`, `positive`, `negative`) so you can properly test both programs.

Would you like me to **run this new test set through the same fallback sentiment analyzer here** (so you can see immediate labeled results), and also provide you with a ready-to-run script for the Transformer + TextBlob programs using this balanced dataset?

> Now run separate tests using the 2 sentiment analysis programs generated above on this newly generated test set.

I ran your **balanced 15-sentence test set** through both programs. Here‚Äôs what happened:

- **TextBlob** ran successfully here, and its labels are shown in the table titled **‚ÄúTransformer vs TextBlob on balanced test set (attempted run)‚Äù** above.
- The **Transformer** pipeline couldn‚Äôt initialize in this offline environment (it needs to download the model). You‚Äôll see blank `transformer_label` cells with an explanatory note in `transformer_note` for each row.

If you‚Äôd like, I can export those TextBlob results to a CSV from here. And if you run my `test_bench.py` locally (with internet), you‚Äôll get the full side-by-side comparison including Transformer predictions.

> You are allowed to access internet to access online datasets. Now, test the program using TextBlob on the kaggle dataset. Specifically, using the "test.csv" dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset for testing. You may run the test with only the first 30 entries in test.csv.

. Since the web environment here can't bypass those restrictions, I'm unable to directly fetch the file.

However, you can still proceed! Here's how:

---

###  Local Setup Instructions

1. **Download the data**:
   - Go to the Kaggle dataset page you shared and download `test.csv` manually to your local machine.

2. **Place the file** in the same directory as this script below.

3. **Run this Python script** (assuming you have `textblob` installed):

```bash
pip install textblob
```

```python
# local_test_kaggle.py
import pandas as pd
from textblob import TextBlob

def textblob_sentiment(text: str) -> str:
    polarity = TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
    if polarity > 0.1:
        return "positive"
    elif polarity < -0.1:
        return "negative"
    return "neutral"

def main():
    # Adjust path if needed
    df = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
    # Assuming test.csv has a column named 'text'; adjust if different
    texts = df["text"].astype(str).tolist()[:30]
    results = []

    for t in texts:
        lbl = textblob_sentiment(t)
        results.append({"text": t, "textblob_label": lbl})

    result_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
    print(result_df)

    # Optionally, save to CSV:
    # result_df.to_csv("kaggle_textblob_results.csv", index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

###  What This Does:
- Reads the first 30 rows of your local `test.csv`.
- Applies the **TextBlob**-based sentiment function to each text.
- Prints out the sentence and its assigned label (`neutral`, `positive`, or `negative`).

---

Once you run this and get the results, feel free to paste a few rows here‚Äîand I can help you interpret the performance or compare it against a Transformer model locally if you're able to run it. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

> Okay, I am uploading the test.csv. Run the tests one the uploaded dataset.

I ran **TextBlob sentiment analysis** on the **first 30 rows of your uploaded Kaggle `test.csv` dataset**.  

You now have a table titled **‚ÄúTextBlob Sentiment on first 30 rows of Kaggle test.csv‚Äù** that shows:
- the original tweet text,  
- the ground-truth label (`sentiment` column from the dataset), and  
- the **TextBlob-predicted label** (`textblob_label`).  

From the sample you can see TextBlob works but often disagrees with the ground-truth labels ‚Äî especially on short or sarcastic texts, where it struggles (e.g., ‚ÄúI THINK EVERYONE HATES ME ON HERE lol‚Äù ‚Üí human label = *negative*, TextBlob = *positive*).  

üëâ Would you like me to also calculate **accuracy / precision / recall** for these first 30 rows, so you can quantify how well TextBlob performs against the dataset labels?

> Yes

Here‚Äôs the **evaluation of TextBlob** on the first 30 rows of the Kaggle `test.csv`:

- **Accuracy:** 50%  

- **Detailed report:**
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

    positive       0.45      0.71      0.56         7
     neutral       0.38      0.56      0.45         9
    negative       0.83      0.36      0.50        14

    accuracy                           0.50        30
   macro avg       0.56      0.54      0.50        30
weighted avg       0.61      0.50      0.50        30
```

üìä **Insights:**
- TextBlob does well with **negative precision (0.83)** but misses many negatives (recall only 0.36).  
- It‚Äôs better at recognizing **positive tweets** (recall 0.71) than neutrals.  
- Overall performance is mediocre (~50% accuracy), showing the limitations of rule-based sentiment analysis on real-world, short, informal text.  

Would you like me to **run the same evaluation with the Transformer model** as well (that should give higher accuracy), now that you know how TextBlob performs?
